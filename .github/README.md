# Handworks Cleaning Services System

A centralized, scalable service platform designed to optimize booking, scheduling, operations, and administration for Handworks Cleaning Services. Built on distributed microservices, the system supports cross-platform access and automates key workflows across clients, cleaners, and admin roles.

---
# How to Run
- First run the gateway
```
cd ./gateway
go run main.go
```
- Then run each service (if applicable when you test)
```
cd .services/{service name eg.. account}
go run main.go
```

## Overview

The system, **‚ÄúOptimizing Service Delivery through a Centralized Booking and Operations Management System for Handworks Cleaning Services‚Äù**, is built using a **distributed microservices architecture**, breaking down business domains (e.g., bookings, workforce, payments, inventory) into independently developed modules. This ensures scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.

It supports three main user roles:

* **Clients** (web portal)
* **Cleaners/Employees** (dedicated Android app)
* **Administrators/Managers** (desktop app)

---

## System Architecture

### üîπ Client Web Application

* **React + Vite (deployed on Netlify)**
* Fully responsive design (desktop + mobile)
* Features:

  * Service browsing & booking
  * Online payment (30% down payment required)
  * Upload job-related images
  * Post-job feedback
* **Guest bookings are not permitted**; login with verified account is required.

### üîπ Cleaner (Employee) Mobile Application

* **Android SDK (Java + XML)**
* Proprietary, internally distributed app (not Play Store)
* Features:

  * Real-time job notifications
  * Task viewing and progress updates
  * Upload before/after photos
  * Sync with backend for coordination

### üîπ Admin Desktop Application

* **Electron + React**
* Features:

  * Management dashboards
  * Scheduling & resource allocation
  * Reports & analytics
  * Works offline with auto-sync when reconnected

---

## Backend Microservices

Each domain (bookings, employees, payments, inventory) is an independent **Go (Golang)** microservice with its own **PostgreSQL (Neon)** database. Key features:

* Modular and scalable design
* REST, GraphQL, and gRPC APIs
* Role-based access control
* Cloud-hosted per service database

---

## Communication & Data Flow

### API Gateway (REST)

* **Go (Gin framework)**
* Functions:

  * Request validation
  * OAuth 2.0 authentication (via **Clerk**)
  * JWT-based access control
  * Rate limiting
  * Routing requests to services

### GraphQL Domain Services

* **gqlgen (Go)** per domain
* Precise data queries
* Strong typing and flexible dashboards

### gRPC Inter-Service Communication

* High-performance service-to-service calls
* Used for:

  * Cleaner assignments
  * Inventory checks
  * Real-time booking workflows

### Event-Driven Messaging

* **NATS + JetStream**
* Publish-subscribe messaging backbone
* Handles:

  * Booking creation events
  * Assignment & notification delivery
  * Payment confirmations
  * Inventory updates
* JetStream adds durability & message persistence

### Integrated TLS Security

* TLS for **REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and NATS**
* Clerk-managed JWT tokens
* Role-based enforcement at API gateway & service level

## Security Model

* **TLS encryption** across all communication channels
* **Clerk OAuth2 + JWT** for authentication & authorization
* Role-based permissions enforced at API Gateway & microservice endpoints
* Offline support for admin app with secure re-sync
* Durable messaging via **NATS JetStream**

---

## Quality Assurance

* **Unit tests** for each microservice
* **Integration tests** for workflows (e.g., booking + assignment)
* **End-to-end tests** via API Gateway
* Automated testing pipelines via **GitHub Actions**

---

## Technical Highlights

## Final Considerations

The Handworks Cleaning Services platform delivers a robust, modular architecture optimized for:

* Seamless client booking
* Real-time cleaner coordination
* Secure admin workflows
* Scalable, fault-tolerant expansion

Its distributed design ensures that future updates, integrations, and scaling can be achieved without disrupting core system operations.
